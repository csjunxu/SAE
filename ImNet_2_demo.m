% We used GoogleNet features.
% X_tr: train data Ntr by d matrix. Ntr is the number of train samples, d
% is the feature dimension size.
% X_te: test  data Nte by d matrix. Nte is the number of test samples. 
% Y: Ntr by c label matrix (consists of one-hot vector). c is the number of classes. 
% S_tr is Ntr by k matrix. k is the semantic dimension size.
