%% %%% AwA DEMO
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Following code shows a demo for AwA dataset to reproduce the result of the paper:
% 
% Semantic Autoencoder for Zero-shot Learning. 
% 
% Elyor Kodirov, Tao Xiang, and Shaogang Gong
% To appear in CVPR 2017.
%

% You are supposed to get following:
% [1] AwA ZSL accuracy [V >>> S]: 84.7%
% [2] AwA ZSL accuracy [S >>> V]: 84.0%
